---

## Areas for Potential Enhancement

### 1. Early Batch Skills
**Issue:** First 6 skills (SPM, FSL, AFNI, FreeSurfer, ANTs, MRtrix3) are shorter and less detailed than later batches.

**Recommendation:** Consider expanding these foundation tools to match the depth of recent batches (600+ lines).

**Priority:** Medium - They're functional but could be more comprehensive.

### 2. Code Example Balance
**Observation:** Some skills heavily favor one language (e.g., MATLAB-only or Python-only).

**Recommendation:** Where applicable, show equivalent examples in multiple environments.

**Priority:** Low - Most tools are language-specific by nature.

### 3. Visual Content
**Observation:** Skills are text-heavy with code blocks but no embedded images/diagrams.

**Status:** This is acceptable for markdown skills. Visual QC typically done interactively.

**Action:** None needed.
